Did it hurt when you fell from heaven
BY SYLVIA KE

With blood fused spit
	shot through the missing tooth,
		she answers: no,

Not as much
	as falling from the kitchen 
		into a sexless basement.
I understand.

She used to dance
	herself across the garden
 		where all were naked.
Muted by softness,
	her steps
		land on pebbles covered with white
mists. Under ripples of her dress
	she swims
		in a fishless sea.
