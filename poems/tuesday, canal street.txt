Tuesday, Canal Street
BY SYLVIA KE

When vomit pushed through
my throat like and untamed fist
Spinach wrapped in string of blood
Lumpy, sweet, and sour.
My child,
Faintly sprawled along the harsh white tiles.

These are the thoughts I tried to put into words
Wrong words that barely scratches those thoughts
Because they are in a wrong language,
Not the language that I own, but the one that owns me.

Mother, they've got me.
I no longer belong to me now,
Not my thoughts, nor my language,
But an empty cage, humming
Crooked, jagged noise that used to be songs,
Sang by the bird who was once there,
who has now disappeared, leaving
No feather, nor bone.
