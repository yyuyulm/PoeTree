Work of Love
BY SYLVIA KE

Darling, go grab that candy from the shelf, will you?
Yes, reach with your arm twisted, stick it into your mouth,
and spit it out because its sweetness, just like those postcards
they sold to unbroken hearts, is insincere.

You close your eyes, every night and every morning,
because you believe they said stay true to your desire
just like how the newborn puppy, who bites
off your finger with its teeth half-emerged
from the gum. You can scream like you wanted 
but not in the way you wanted, and the reason
why you scream never really matters, or does it,
my love?

Oh you,
you blinded follower
like a fly tricked by the phone screen
that lights up when my mom texted,
despite the thousands of eyes, growing into two
swirls on the side of your head, which remind me
of how you stir your pasta, which I liked,
or your hair when you are thinking about things
that I don't know and don't care about, like
those laundries stained by the oily water
splattered on you when you wash the dishes.
You hug me after, smudging the grease

everywhere,
like the smell of Greek
food in your car when you picked me
up from the airport. A Moment
when my mind demands hate,
but my body whispers love.
